## Interceptors

OKHttp lets you manipulate your requests and/or responses through interceptors,
which let you monitor, change or even retry API calls.

OkHttp allows two types of interceptors:

- Application interceptors:  Act between your code and OkHttp
- Network interceptors: Act between OkHttp and the server
