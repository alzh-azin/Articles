# Kotlin DSL: Gradle scripts in Android made easy

> Managing dependencies in large android projects is still cumbersome and hectic and that unfamiliar groovy syntax makes it even harder to understand the changes.

Kotlin DSL brings the simplicity of the Kotlin language syntax and rich API set right into the script files on top of that code completion makes it perfect to work with Gradle script files. We will use this to manage our dependencies and project settings configurations more elegantly. Kotlin DSL files have extension as **.kts** so we will be converting all of our **.gradle** files to **.gradle.kts**
